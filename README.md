# Ads-Click-Through-Rate-Prediction
Ads Click Through Rate is the ratio of how many users clicked on your ad to how many users viewed your ad. For example, 5 out of 100 users click on the ad while watching a youtube video. So, in this case, the CTR of the youtube ad will be 5%. Analyzing the click-through rate help companies in finding the best ad for their target audience.
# Introduction
Ads Click-through rate prediction means predicting whether the user will click on the ad. In the task of ads click-through rate prediction, we need to train a Machine Learning model to find relationships between the characteristics of all the users who click on ads. I found an ideal dataset for this task containing data about the user and whether the user clicked on the ad
# Features
lick-through rate is the ratio of users who clicked on an ad/link to the number of total users who left impressions on the ad/link. In simple words, clicks รท impressions = CTR.
